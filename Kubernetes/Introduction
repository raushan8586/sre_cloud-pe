Production systems:
1. Auto-healing of containers
2. auto-scaling of containers --> scale-out and scale-in
3. auto-deployment of containers
4. auto-scheuling
5. auto-clustering

A container Engine is unable to provide above features.
Container Engine -> Docker, Containerd, Podman, Rocket

We need Container Orchestration Engine --> Kuberntes, Docker Swarm
