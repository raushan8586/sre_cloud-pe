Production systems:
1. Auto-healing of containers
2. auto-scaling of containers --> scale-out and scale-in
3. auto-deployment of containers
4. auto-scheduling
5. auto-clustering

A container Engine is unable to provide above features.
Container Engine -> Docker, Containerd, Podman, Rocket

We need Container Orchestration Engine --> Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm

K8s --> Google --> CNCF --> Open Source
Borg

AWS --> EKS (Managed Service) -> 0.25$/hr
Azure --> AKS
GCP --> GKE
Oracle --> OKE

Kubernetes Objects:
1. Pods
2. Replica Set --> To maintain stable number of replica pods --> Auto-healing
3. Deployment --> auto-deployment without downtime
4. Services --> to expose the pods
  a. NodePort Service (to expose the front-end pods)
  b. ClusterIP Service (to load balance the traffic across back-end pods)
  c. LoadBalancer Service (to load balance the traffic across multiple nodes)
